# Paradox Game Converters

These tools allow games from various Paradox Interactive games to be continued in other Paradox Interactive games. Using these tools, a game can be played from [Europa Universalis 4](https://eu4.paradoxwikis.com/Europa_Universalis_4_Wiki), to [Victoria 2](https://vic2.paradoxwikis.com/Victoria_2_Wiki), to [Hearts of Iron 4](https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Hearts_of_Iron_4_Wiki). They also work with the [official Crusader Kings II to Europa Universalis 4 converter](https://ck2.paradoxwikis.com/Europa_Universalis_4_Save_Converter), the [unofficial Crusader Kings 2 to Europa Universalis 4 converter](https://github.com/kingofmen/CK2toEU4/), and the [Hearts of Iron 4 to Stellaris converter](https://github.com/PTSnoop/HoI4-to-Stellaris-Converter).

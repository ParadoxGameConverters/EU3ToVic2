Readme:

This is a one to one country converter for EU3 To VIC2 so countries will carry over and be playable In VIC2

Paste files from this archive over VIC2 this is due to how the converter works not the mod so backup the folders or make a copy of VIC2

Copy Country_mappings.txt and cultureMap.txt to the converter folder and overwrite as needed and ensure the convert.bat is looking for the right VIC2 directory if you made a copy

Uninstall:

Delete Folders and restore backed up ones Etc

Error List:
1. Sometimes the game crashes after the end of the year so ensure you save before (Proberly a autosave problem?)
2. Game might get corrupted somehow down the road if you play for a long time from the start without saving after you start a game (May not happen anymore due to fixed 0_Names.csv)
